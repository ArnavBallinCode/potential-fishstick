# Potential Fishstick

This repository serves as a collection of random coding ideas and experiments. It contains various scripts and programs that explore different concepts, algorithms, and functionalities. Below are descriptions of some of the files currently in the repository.

## Files

### 1. `Recover.c`
`Recover.c` is a program that recovers JPEG files from a forensic image. It scans through a raw data file, identifies the beginning of JPEG files based on specific byte patterns, and writes each recovered file to disk with a sequential filename (e.g., "001.jpg", "002.jpg"). The program is useful for data recovery and digital forensics.

### 2. `Bricks.py`
`Bricks.py` is a simple Python script that prints a pyramid of bricks. The user is prompted to enter the height of the pyramid (between 1 and 8), and the program prints a left-aligned pyramid of the specified height using the `#` character. The script includes error handling to ensure valid input and demonstrates basic control flow and string manipulation in Python.

## Usage
- For `Recover.c`, compile and run the program, providing a forensic image file as input to recover any embedded JPEG files.
- For `Bricks.py`, simply run the script and follow the prompt to input the desired height of the pyramid.
